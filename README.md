# xenon-js

*An impossibly small jQuery replacement that encourages Javascript standards*

To use xenon in your own project, just download and reference [`xe.js`](./xe.js).

Alternatively, copy and paste it into your code.

## Developing

I use Visual Studio Code with the Minify (HookyQR) extension. The minify configuration is included, although it doesn't build a perfectly minified output.

## Building

run `node install` and `npm start` to compile xenon using the included build.js script.
